# Responsive-Portfolio

## Getting Started

In this project I have three webpages: Home/About Me, Portfolio, Contact. Every page has a matching nav bar and footer with links. The nav bar has links to the other pages, and the footer has links to my github and my social. Every page has a matching header which has an image and my name as the title. The About Me page shows a small section of text that tells the reader a bit about me, and has an image to go with it. The portfolio page shows images that I took in two categories: flowers and cityscapes. Each section has headers that title the section. The contact page has text fields that the users can input. Every page has a matching background.
